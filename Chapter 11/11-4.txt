\f0\fs36 \cf0 Imagine you have a 20GB file with one string per line. Explain how you would sort the file.\
\
Solution: We'll divide the file into chunks which are x megabytes each, where x is the amount of memory we have available. Each chunk is sorted separately and then saved back to the file system.\
\
Once all the chunks are sorted, we then merge the chunks, one by one. At the end, we have a fully sorted file.\
\
The algorithm is known as external sort.}
